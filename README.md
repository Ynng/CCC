# Canadian Computer Contest

For syncing my progress on the CCC questions across devices.

I did not spend any time polishing any of these solutions, so they might be unoptimized.

The solutions that don't pass all the test cases are in the "WIP" folder. I'm still learning about Computer Science and is on my way to solve them.
